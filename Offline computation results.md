## Offline computation results

We show our offline computation results in this markdown in the form of figure (case 1) and animation (case 2, 3 and 4).

## Case 1

## Case 2

Note that the offline results shown in the animation is the projection to the first and third dimensions but the set membership is still checked online in the complete 4-dimensional state space (also for later case studies). You can also plot feasible set in other dimensions by your own.



## Case 3



## Case 4
